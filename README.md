# fear_speech
Repository for fear speech project

This project attempts to study fear speech, with a special attention to different types/levels of fear speech (suspicion, hate speech). The repository contains the input json file, which needs to be force-converted to CSV, using the script EDA.ipynb. Then, the csv data is to be loaded by fear_speech_classifier.ipynb. This code implements a BERT based classifier to classify fear speech.
